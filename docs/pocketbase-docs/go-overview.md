Overview

### [Getting started](#getting-started)
 PocketBase can be used as regular Go package that exposes various helpers and hooks to help you implement
 your own custom portable application.
 A new PocketBase instance is created via
 [pocketbase.New()](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#New)
 or
 [pocketbase.NewWithConfig(config)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#NewWithConfig)
 .
 Once created you can register your custom business logic via the available
 [event hooks](/docs/go-event-hooks/)
 and call
 [app.Start()](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#PocketBase.Start)
 to start the application.
 Below is a minimal example:

- [Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Create a new project directory with main.go file inside it.
 As a reference, you can also explore the prebuilt executable
 [example/base/main.go](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/master/examples/base/main.go)
 file. package main

import (
 "log"
 "os"

 "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
 "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis"
 "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)

func main() {
 app := pocketbase.New()

 app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
 // serves static files from the provided public dir (if exists)
 se.Router.GET("/{path...}", apis.Static(os.DirFS("./pb_public"), false))

 return se.Next()
 })

 if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
 }
}
- To init the dependencies, run go mod init myapp && go mod tidy.
- To start the application, run go run . serve.
- To build a statically linked executable, run go build
 and then you can start the created executable with
 ./myapp serve.

### [Custom SQLite driver](#custom-sqlite-driver)
 The general recommendation is to use the builtin SQLite setup but if you need more
 advanced configuration or extensions like ICU, FTS5, etc. you'll have to specify a custom driver/build.
 Note that PocketBase by default doesn't require CGO because it uses the pure Go SQLite port
 [modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite), but this may not be the case when using a custom SQLite driver!

 PocketBase v0.23+ added support for defining a DBConnect function as app configuration to
 load custom SQLite builds and drivers compatible with the standard Go database/sql.
 The DBConnect function is called twice - once for
 pb_data/data.db
 (the main database file) and second time for pb_data/auxiliary.db (used for logs and other ephemeral
 system meta information).
 If you want to load your driver conditionally and fallback to the default handler, then you can
 call
 [core.DefaultDBConnect](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#DefaultDBConnect)
 .

 As a side-note, if you are not planning to use core.DefaultDBConnect
 fallback as part of your custom driver registration you can exclude the default pure Go driver with
 go build -tags no_default_driver to reduce the binary size a little (~4MB).
 Below are some minimal examples with commonly used external SQLite drivers:
 This is a CGO driver and requires to build your application with CGO_ENABLED=1.

import (

// register a new driver with default PRAGMAs and the same query
// builder implementation as the already existing sqlite3 builder
func init() {
 // initialize default PRAGMAs for each new connection
 sql.Register("pb_sqlite3",
 &sqlite3.SQLiteDriver{
 ConnectHook: func(conn *sqlite3.SQLiteConn) error {
 _, err := conn.Exec(`
 PRAGMA busy_timeout = 10000;
 PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
 PRAGMA journal_size_limit = 200000000;
 PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
 PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
 PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
 PRAGMA cache_size = -32000;
 `, nil)

 return err
 },
 },
 )

 dbx.BuilderFuncMap["pb_sqlite3"] = dbx.BuilderFuncMap["sqlite3"]
}

func main() {
 app := pocketbase.NewWithConfig(pocketbase.Config{
 DBConnect: func(dbPath string) (*dbx.DB, error) {
 return dbx.Open("pb_sqlite3", dbPath)
 },
 })

 // any custom hooks or plugins...

 if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
 log.Fatal(err)
 }
